This is a bot, that you can talk to.

To begin with, install the dependencies and run the bot.py file.

There are several things it could do. Some of them are:

. Searches the web for you
. Sends mails on your behalf
. Tells jokes (Uses API for that)
. Creates reminders
. And several other things


I am coming up with more functionalities to add, wherein it will use more API to fetch mopre information such as weather, booking tickets using voices,making reservations, ordering food, even singing (**winks**).

Please contribute to the project if you can. We can make it cooler.
